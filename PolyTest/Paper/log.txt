090507: PJ: Setting up a paper infrastructure

  I have copied recently updated bibtex files from proposals/bibtex/
  {- proposals is in a CVS repository:
  :ext;CVS_RSH=ssh:candela03.ita.chalmers.se:/chalmers/groups/cse-set/cvs
  -}

  (I'm not sure if the "completely open" repository at
  git@github.com:jyp/topics is the right place for a "paper in
  making".)
