  abstract =	 {\emph{Generic programming} aims to increase the
                  flexibility of programming languages, by expanding
                  the possibilities for parametrization~--- ideally,
                  without also expanding the possibilities for
                  uncaught errors. The term means different things to
                  different people: \emph{parametric polymorphism},
                  \emph{data abstraction}, \emph{meta-programming},
                  and so on. We use it to mean polytypism, that is,
                  parametrization by the \emph{shape} of data
                  structures rather than their contents. To avoid
                  confusion with other uses, we have coined the
                  qualified term \emph{datatype-generic programming}
                  for this purpose.  In these lecture notes, we expand
                  on the definition of datatype-generic programming,
                  and present some examples of datatype-generic
                  programs. We also explore the connection with
                  \emph{design patterns} in object-oriented
                  programming; in particular, we argue that certain
                  design patterns are just higher-order
                  datatype-generic programs.}

                  so-called \emph{genericity} of the paradigm. The
                  sorts of parameters that can be envisaged in a
                  programming language range from simple values, like
                  integers and floating-point numbers,through
                  structured values, types and classes, to kinds (the
                  type of types and/or
                  classes). \emph{Datatype-generic programming} is
                  about parametrising programs by the structure of the
                  data that they manipulate, exploiting that structure
                  when it is relevant and ignoring it when it is
                  not. Programming languages most commonly used at the
                  present time do not provide effective mechanisms for
                  documenting and implementing datatype
                  genericity. This volume is a contribution towards
                  improving the state of the art.}

  abstract =	 "A generic function is a function that is defined on
                  the structure of data types: with a single
                  definition, we obtain a function that works for many
                  data types. In contrast, an ad-hoc polymorphic
                  function requires a separate implementation for each
                  data type. Previous work by Hinze on lightweight
                  generic programming has introduced techniques that
                  allow the definition of generic functions directly
                  in Haskell. A severe drawback of these approaches is
                  that generic functions, once defined, cannot be
                  extended with ad-hoc behaviour for new data types,
                  precluding the design of an extensible and modular
                  generic programming library based on these
                  techniques. In this paper, we present a revised
                  version of Hinze's Generics for the masses approach
                  that overcomes this limitation. Using our new
                  technique, writing an extensible and modular generic
                  programming library in Haskell 98 is possible."

  abstract =	 {With the recent developments in the C++ language,
                  concepts are mostly discussed as a form of
                  constrained polymorphism. Yet, concepts also allow
                  for an alternative, implementation-independent view
                  that comes from their origin in (algebraic)
                  specification languages. In this paper, we return to
                  this specification view on concepts and formalize
                  C++ concepts as institutions, a well-established
                  notion for precise specifications of software
                  components. We argue that institutions form a
                  suitable theoretical framework for software systems
                  like libraries where the different parts establish
                  relations that are captured by different logics, or
                  no formal logic at all. Assuming the C++ concept
                  descriptions, concept maps, and axioms as in the
                  draft currently accepted by the C++ standardization
                  committee, we show that concept descriptions and
                  axioms form an institution (with equational logic)
                  but also, and perhaps surprisingly, that concept
                  descriptions and concept maps form an institution
                  (with no formal logic). },
