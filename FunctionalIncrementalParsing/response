In response to review #1, I'd like to say that, while there is a lot of
folklore about the expressive power of lazy evaluation, I feel that there are
few documented non-trivial applications. Detailing what laziness implies in 
the case of incremental parsing is a useful contribution to the functional
programming community.

In response to review #3:

About the simplification of compositions:
  * Yes, evaluation under lambda would solve the problem;
  * Yes, using combinators can solve the problem. Indeed, the solution
presented in the paper is an instance of this approach.

About the essential uses of lazy evaluation:
Section 8 details the benefits of using lazy evaluation.
I'm not sure how this falls short of listing the essential usages
of lazy evaluation.

Thanks for the helpful reviews!
